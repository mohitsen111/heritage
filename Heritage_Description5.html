                            <p>This temple was built in 1735 by queen Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar of the Holkar dynasty, who retrieved the idol of god Ganesha from a well where it had been hidden, to keep it safe from the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. The devotees circle around the temple and tie a thread to pray to Lord Ganesha for the successful completion of their work. It is said that the ancient idol in the temple was seen in a dream of a local priest, Pandit Mangal Bhatt. The temple is still managed by the Bhatt family.</p>
