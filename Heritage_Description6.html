                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>The powerful family that built the chhatris, the Holkars, were originally a minor clan within the Maratha empire. They belonged to the Dhangar caste, which originated in Maharashtra. While in Maratha service, the Holkars fought against the Mughal empire and the British East India Company. However, following the Third Anglo-Maratha War and the subsequent collapse of the Maratha empire in 1818, the Holkars agreed to establish a protectorate on behalf of the East India Company in Indore.This diplomatic move established the Holkar dynasty, which ruled Indore until Indian Independence in 1948.The Krishnapura Chhatri themselves were built in the mid 19th century to honor the deceased members of the Holkar dynasty.</p>
