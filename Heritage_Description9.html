                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>The history of this temple dates back to 1986 when the sculptures of 24 Jain Tirthankaras and Lord Bahubali were established on the mountain of Gomatgiri. There are a total of 24 temples made of marble here, that is Sangmarmar and each temple is dedicated to the 24 Tirthankaras of Jainism. Many devotees come to this place to worship and pray. A major reason religious visitors come here is the footprints of all 24 Tirthankaras established at Gomatgiri. It is also believed that this place has a collection of religious books and it is called SaraswatiParisar. It is believed that many unfortunate books are kept here.</p>
