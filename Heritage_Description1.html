                            <p>Built in the year 1766 by the rulers of the Holkar Dynasty, the grand Rajwada Palace is one of the top heritage places to visit in Indore. This seven-storied palace, which exhibits a mix of Maratha, French, and Mughal architectural styles, is a fine example of royal splendor. The entrance of the palace features a grand archway and a huge wooden gate complete with iron studs. The main building comprises a courtyard, ornate balconies and windows, jharokas, elaborately carved wooden jalis, corridors, and galleried rooms.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>The Rajwada Palace was constructed in 1747 A.D. by the founder of Holkar Dynasty, Malhar Rao Holkar. It was set on fire for the first time in 1801 by the commander Sarjerao Ghadge of the Sindhiya Dynasty.Reconstruction took place between 1818 and 1826, and five floors were reconstructed during this time. In 1834, a second fire took place, and the topmost floor was destroyed. The last fire, which broke out in 1984, had caused the maximum destruction to the structure and the back side of the palace was destroyed entirely. The temple of Malhari Martand, which is located inside the palace, was also wholly ruined during the riots of 1984.Now, only the front part of the original structure remains. The palace has recently been renovated, which has managed to bring back the old glory to some extent.</p>
