                            <p>Phooti Kothi, meaning ‘broken palace’ in Hindi, is a half-completed, abandoned royal residence located in Sudama Nagar in south-west Indore. The building is the only example of incomplete Holkar architecture, with construction starting in 1886, and being abandoned in 1902. At present, the building lies barren, and is said to be ‘cursed’ and ‘haunted’ according to local legend, which believes that the site was doomed from the start</p>

                        <p>The Phooti Kothi on Sukhniwas Road is the only architecture of Holkar Era which remains incomplete. Yet, it holds immense heritage value. The Kothi’s construction work started in 1886 and it continued till 1902. It was developed under king Shivaji Rao Holkar. The main purpose to develop the building was to attack the British cantonment in Mhow. According to the archaeology department official, Dr DP Pandey, as soon as the British officer deployed at Indore Residency came to know about the purpose behind the development of Phooti Kothi, he immediately stopped the work. He refuted all the myths which says that the Kothi was cursed that it will never get completed and its roof cannot be built.</p>
