                            <p>A peek into the impact of British autonomy on Indore pre-independence, the Indore White Church is one of the most significant points of interest of the city. A testimony to awe-striking European architecture, the entire structure is made of milk white stone and marble. To witness the church in all its glory during Christmas, decorated from head to toe, is a sight for sore eyes.</p>

                        <p>White Church is the oldest church of entire central India. Built under British Raj in the year 1858 and completed on 9th August of that year, this church has European style of architecture. It was established by the Protestants community of Indore for the Christians residing in India and those Army personnel who visited the country during those days. It was originally named as St. Annâ€™s Church which later became White Church, probably due to its white color that adorns this building since that era.</p>
