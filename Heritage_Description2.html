                            <p>An example of architectural magnificence, this palace once contained one of the best rose gardens in the country. The construction of Lal Bagh Palace, or the Red Palace, began in the late nineteenth century and was completed in 1926 by the Holkar dynasty, one of the most powerful Maratha rulers of India.The architecture reflects Italian Renaissance Revival style, making it one of Indiaâ€™s finest neo-classical buildings. It is renowned for its European influenced interiors, among the finest surviving of this period in India.

                        <p> Starting with Tukojirao Holkar II in 1886, who acquired this property and was completed under his grandson, Tukojirao Holkar III in 1926. It was built in the Italian Renaissance Revival architecture style. It once had 20-acre rose garden, while its main gates were modelled on those at Buckingham Palace by Triggs of Calcutta.After the death of Tukojirao Holkar III in 1978, his third wife, an American, Sharmishtha Devi (formerly Nancy Anne Miller) moved out and subsequently, the palace was converted into a museum and much of the first floor was destroyed in a fire. In the 1980s the palace fell into disrepair and was prone to theft of its antiques before the state government acquired the property in 1987 for Rs 64.46 lakh.</p>
