                            <p>Built during the reign of Mandu Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din Khilji, in the late 15th century, the Jahaz Mahal in Mandu is an important and famous monumental site in Madhya Pradesh. The place owes its name to the striking illusion it creates of being afloat, as it is surrounded by the waters of Munj Talao and Kapur Talao.The intricate carvings, architectural brilliance and the beauty that sum up the Jahaz Mahal make it one of the most essential places to visit near Indore. </p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>The history of Jahaz Mahal is closely related to the rich history of Mandu itself. The main purpose behind building this imposing building was to comfortably accommodate all of the 15,000 women of Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din Khilji's royal women.The harem was constructed in such a manner that it shielded the women from the eyes of the common man, but at the same time gave them full autonomy over their freedom. Here, the Sultan's consorts enjoyed a life of luxuries and pleasures. However, Jahaz Mahal lost its original splendour after Ghiyas-ud-din Khilji's death. The last royal visit to the palace was paid by Mughal emperor Jahangir and his favourite wife Nur Jahan in 1617, who described the experience as " a wonderful assembly".</p>
